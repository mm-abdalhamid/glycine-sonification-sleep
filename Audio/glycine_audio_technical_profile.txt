Glycine Sonification Audio – Technical Profile
File: glycine_evaporation_zwitterion_5min.wav (evaporation-only legacy stimulus)

Quick technical profile

From the file:
    • Sampling rate: 22,050 Hz
    • Channels: stereo
    • Exact duration: 300 seconds = 5:00 minutes
    • Overall level:
        • RMS ≈ 0.095 (on a -1 to +1 scale) → moderate loudness
        • Peak ≈ 0.70 → no brutal clipping spikes

Frequency content (averaged over the whole 5 min):

Approximate power distribution:
    • 0–20 Hz: essentially negligible
    • 20–60 Hz: very low
    • 60–200 Hz: ~30% of total power
    • 200–1000 Hz: ~70% of total power
    • >1 kHz: almost nothing

So:
    • The spectral centroid / median is around 260 Hz.
    • It is a mid-band, body-friendly profile:
        • no big sub-bass rumble,
        • almost no bright, sharp treble.

The loudness envelope over 1-second windows:
    • RMS ranges roughly from 0.03 → 0.19, averaging ≈ 0.09.
    • So there is breathing-like variation, but not violent jumps.

Comparing 1-second segments across the file, the correlation with the first second drops quickly —
the pattern is structured but not a tight, looped beat.

Note on PK-based stimulus:
    • The main manuscript stimulus `glycine_evaporation_zwitterion_5min_pk_kinetic.wav` uses the same
      vibrational mapping and 5-minute duration, but its amplitude is shaped by a compressed oral
      pharmacokinetic envelope. Its exact statistics will differ slightly, but it retains the same
      general mid-band, non-harsh profile.
