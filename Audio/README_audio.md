# Glycine Sonification – Audio Folder

This folder contains the core sonification audio file and supporting documentation for the glycine project.

## Files

- `glycine_evaporation_zwitterion_5min.wav`  
  Five‑minute audio sonification derived from the zwitterionic form of glycine and its evaporation sequence mapping. Designed as a structured, mid‑band stimulus for experimental and exploratory use in thermoregulation / sleep context (no therapeutic claims).

- `glycine_audio_technical_profile.txt`  
  Plain‑text technical profile of the WAV file, including:
  - sampling rate, channels, and duration  
  - RMS and peak levels  
  - approximate spectral power distribution  
  - loudness envelope characteristics  
  This file is intended to give researchers a quick engineering‑level view of the signal.

- `glycine_audio_playback_recommendations.txt`  
  Minimal playback guidance for experimental use, summarised as:
  - keep volume moderate (comfortable, not blasting)  
  - prefer playback from a speaker at chest level or lower, a bit away from the head (not in‑ear)  

## Intended Use

The audio is a **non‑chemical representation** of glycine’s structure and vibrational mapping. It is intended for:

- methodological and conceptual work on molecule‑derived audio patterns,  
- exploratory research on structured sound in relation to thermoregulation / sleep biology, and  
- replication or extension studies that require a well‑described stimulus.

It is **not** presented as a treatment or clinical intervention.
