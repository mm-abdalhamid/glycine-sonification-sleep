# Glycine sonification and sigil – For experimenters (prototype guidance)

This note is written for researchers who may want to test the glycine sonification and sigil as
**experimental stimuli**. It is not clinical advice, and the stimuli must not be treated as having
established efficacy for sleep or thermoregulation.

The current framework uses:

- A **5 minute pharmacokinetic (PK) based glycine sonification** generated by
  `glycine_evaporation_zwitterion_5min_pk_kinetic_licensed.py`. This script maps zwitterionic glycine
  vibrational peaks to audio frequencies and applies a one compartment oral PK envelope (0 to 4 hours
  compressed into 300 seconds) to shape the overall amplitude.
- A **5 minute rotating sigil video** generated by
  `glycine_sigil_pk_5min_rotating_licensed.py`, which uses the same PK envelope to modulate the
  opacity of the sigil over time, with a single slow rotation.
- An **earlier evaporation only prototype audio** created by `glycine_evaporation_zwitterion_5min.py`
  and its corresponding sigil script. These are retained as legacy tools for comparison and should be
  clearly distinguished from the PK based stimuli in any experimental report.

All of these materials are **prototypes** designed to make the pipeline testable. They are best used
in small, transparent pilot studies where every step is documented and interpreted cautiously.

## Suggested use in early stage laboratory studies

### Participants and setting

- Start with healthy adult volunteers without severe sleep or psychiatric disorders.
- Conduct sessions in a quiet, dimly lit room with stable ambient temperature.
- Where feasible, document baseline sleep patterns (for example, sleep diaries or actigraphy) for
  several nights before exposure.

### Exposure protocol (pre sleep context)

- Present the **5 minute PK based glycine sonification** (with or without the sigil) once in the
  **30 to 60 minutes** before the participant's habitual bedtime.
- Ask participants to listen using speakers placed at chest level or slightly below. Avoid headphone
  use for safety and to limit head localized sound effects.
- Keep the overall sound level in a comfortable range similar to soft speech or quiet music in the
  room.
- If the sigil video is used, display it on a screen at a comfortable viewing distance, with the room
  otherwise dim to avoid glare or excessive visual stimulation.
- Consider a simple within subject design where each participant experiences several conditions on
  different nights, such as:
  - PK audio only.
  - PK audio plus sigil.
  - A spectrally matched but temporally scrambled control audio.
  - Silence (no audio, no video).

### Outcomes to consider

- **Subjective:** thermal comfort ratings, pre sleep relaxation, perceived sleep onset latency, and
  morning sleep quality ratings.
- **Behavioral or actigraphic:** estimated sleep onset latency, total sleep time, and sleep
  fragmentation using wrist actigraphy or contactless sleep trackers where available.
- **Physiological (if feasible):** distal and proximal skin temperature, heart rate variability, or
  related non invasive temperature proxies, where ethically and practically acceptable.

## Analysis and interpretation

- Treat any observed differences as **preliminary and exploratory**. Small pilot samples will not
  justify strong efficacy claims.
- Report all conditions, exposure durations, and outcome variables transparently, including null
  findings.
- Make clear in any report that the PK envelope is a **plausible, compressed model** of oral glycine
  dynamics rather than a fitted pharmacokinetic curve for each participant.
- Where possible, make derived data and analysis scripts openly available so that other groups can
  replicate or re analyse early results.

## Safety and ethics

- Any study involving human participants must undergo appropriate ethical review and comply with
  local regulatory requirements.
- Participants should be informed that the stimuli are **experimental** and **not clinically
  validated interventions**.
- Avoid giving participants the impression that the audio or sigil will treat insomnia or replace
  established treatments.

The intention of sharing this pipeline is to enable cautious, transparent exploratory work on
molecule anchored audio and visual stimuli. Any claims about benefits to sleep or thermoregulation
should be reserved for carefully designed, adequately powered studies with empirically demonstrated
effects.
