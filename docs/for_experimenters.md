# Glycine sonification and sigil – For experimenters (prototype guidance)

Glycine sonification and sigil  For experimenters (prototype guidance)

The audio files and animated sigil provided with this project are intended as prototype stimuli for exploratory research. They are not medical treatments and are not presented as having established efficacy for sleep or thermoregulation.

Suggested use in early-stage laboratory studies

Participants and setting
- Use healthy adult volunteers without severe sleep or psychiatric disorders for initial pilot work.
- Conduct sessions in a quiet, dimly lit room with stable ambient temperature.
- Where feasible, document baseline sleep patterns (for example, simple sleep diaries or actigraphy) for several nights before exposure.

Exposure protocol (pre-sleep context)
- Present the 5-minute glycine sonification (with or without the sigil) once in the 3060 minutes before habitual bedtime.
- Ask participants to listen using speakers at chest level or comfortable near-field monitors; avoid high-volume headphone use for safety and to limit head-localized sound effects.
- Keep overall sound pressure levels within safe, conversational-range loudness that participants experience as clearly audible but not intrusive.

Conditions and controls
- At minimum, compare the glycine sonification to one or more control conditions, such as:
  (i) a spectrally matched but randomly structured sound,
  (ii) a simple broadband or filtered noise,
  (iii) silence or usual pre-sleep routine.
- If using the sigil, consider including an audio-only condition to help separate audio and visual contributions.

Example outcome measures
- Subjective: thermal comfort ratings, pre-sleep relaxation, perceived sleep onset latency, and morning sleep quality ratings.
- Behavioral/actigraphic: estimated sleep onset latency, total sleep time, and sleep fragmentation using wrist actigraphy or contactless sleep trackers where available.
- Physiological (if feasible): distal and proximal skin temperature (for example, wrist or ankle versus chest), heart rate and heart rate variability derived from ECG or PPG, and simple core body temperature proxies where ethically and practically acceptable.

Analysis and interpretation
- Treat any observed differences as preliminary and exploratory; small pilot samples will not justify strong efficacy claims.
- Report all conditions, exposure durations, and outcome variables transparently, including null findings.
- Where possible, make derived data and analysis scripts openly available so that other groups can replicate or re-analyse early results.

Safety and ethics
- Any study involving human participants should undergo appropriate ethical review and comply with local regulatory requirements.
- Participants should be informed that the stimuli are experimental and not clinically validated interventions.

The intention of sharing this pipeline is to enable cautious, transparent experimentation with molecule-informed audiovisual stimuli, not to promote untested therapeutic claims. Researchers are encouraged to adapt and extend the code, while clearly distinguishing between design hypotheses and empirically demonstrated effects in any subsequent publications.
